# Practical DevOps implementations and contributions based on Microservices Demo – Online Boutique App

- This fork of `microservices-demo` serves as a central index of all my DevOps projects and practical implementations built using the Online Boutique microservices architecture.
- It showcases my hands-on contributions across a range of real-world scenarios — including GitOps, infrastructure provisioning, observability, cloud migration, cost optimization, secure CI/CD pipelines, and progressive delivery.
- Each project reflects modern DevOps practices, platform-specific capabilities, and proven tools — aligned with production-grade architectures and scalable cloud-native workflows.
